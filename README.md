About:

I wrote a client side and a server side to control with current switches. The main idea is to automate the closing of anti-burglary blinds when dusk comes or a certain hour strikes. When dawn comes, the blinds are supposed to go up so that sunlight enters through the windows of our houses. The server side was written in C ++, due to the performance and unstable firmware for the Raspberry Pi Pico W, which, programmed with the Micropython language, could crash. I decided to write the programs on the client side in c#, due to the familiarity with this language and the simplicity of creating multiplatform applications. In addition, the programs have been equipped with the ability to control the blinds and entrances to the house using the application for mobile devices. Thanks to this, we will be able to control anti-burglary blinds from every corner of the house. The principle of operation is simple. The IoT device listens to see if the client side has sent an HTTP request with a given path, e.g. all/up. If an Iot device intercepts such a request, it opens and closes switches simulating pressing a button, isn't it simple?

Setup:

  0) Prepare your board, connect it to relays.
  
  1) Server side
   
     Edit code
     
     Flash IoT device (like ESP8266 or Raspberry PICO W) <- I would recommend Raspberry Pico W beacuse it has 2 cores
    
  2) Client side
  
    Edit code
    
    Install on your device
